# Assignments - DD2424 Deep Learning for Data Science

Individual assignments from the course DD2424 at KTH. The assignments all focused on building fundamental neural network architectures from scratch, utilizing a variety of network architectures, loss functions and regularization methods.

## Technologies

-   [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
-   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
-   [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Assignment Details

### Assignment 1:

Trained and tested a one layer network built from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Network was trained using mini-batch gradient descent coupled with cross-entropy loss and an L2-regularization term on the weight matrix.

### Assignment 2:

Similar to the first assignment, but now with a two layer network.

### Assignment 3:

Generalized the second assignment to work with any number of layers and incorporated batch normalization built from scratch for both training and testing.

### Assignment 4:

Built an RNN from scratch in Python and NumPy with the purpose of synthesizing text.
