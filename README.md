Individual assignments in course DD2424 Deep Learning at KTH

Assignment 1:
Trained and tested a one layer network built from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Network was trained using mini-batch gradient descent coupled with cross-entropy loss and an L2-regularization term on the weight matrix. 

Assignment 2:
Similar to the first assignment, but now with a two layer network.

Assignment 3:
Generalized the second assignment to work with any number of layers and incorporated batch normalization built from scratch fot both training and testing.
